            <p>
              I am a candidate for a Master of Science in Urban Informatics at
              Northeastern University and a Research Assistant at the Boston
              Area Research Initiative (BARI). My current research focuses on
              identifying policy levers to alleviate heat and air pollution in
              the greater Boston area by examining potential causes and effects
              at a regional level.

              <br /><br />

              I grew up in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and I've been a proud
              Boston resident since 2017. My goal is to help Massachusetts
              become a more equitable and efficient place for all its residents.
              While most of my work is focused on the environment and
              transportation, I'm interested in all topics related to urban
              planning and municipal operations.

              <h3>MAPC Multi-Hazard Research</h3>
              <p>
                As climate change continues to progress, our communities need to
                be ready to handle the heat. BARI wanted to investigate what
                kinds of policy could be effective at keeping streets cool and
                clean across the greater Boston area. This research began as a
                regional expansion of work from
                <a
                  href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/2984"

                  OBrien & Mueller
                </a>
                which found a large portion of variability in heat and air
                pollution occurred within neighborhoods in Boston. This pattern
                indicates that the street-by-street infrastructure differences
                have a significant effect on the quality of life of people
                living in the same neighborhood.
              </p>
              <p>
                I joined together parcel data by heavily simplifying street
                names and joining parcels to the closest match. I used this
                along with the structures dataset to determine the effective
                street height width which determines the air flushing rate that
                effects air pollution exposure. The streets are then used to
                extract the satellite data on carbon monoxide emissions, land
                surface temperature, albedo, tree canopy, and impervious surface
                percentage to examine the drivers of heat and air pollution
                along with some other factors. The mixed effects models allow me
                to understand how local and nearby factors affect the livability
                of each street.
              </p>
              <p>
                The final models and findings are currently in the drafting
                process, but one thing that is abundantly clear is that tree
                canopy has an incredible impact on street temperatures at both
                the local, neighborhood, and town level. However, the
                disparities could be better modeled and studied with a network
                of local sensors measuring heat, air pollution, particulate
                matter, and more. A great example of this is the

              <h3>Boston Food Desert Study</h3>
              <p>
                I currently live in a part of the city that is about a 20-minute
                walk away from the nearest grocery store. This combined with the
                lack of tree canopy on that walk led me to use the MBTA rapid
                transit system to take the train to a grocery store located very
                close to a station. The travel time is about the same, but it's
                much cooler and easier. I wondered what other means are
                available to bridge the gap between where people live and where
                they buy fresh food.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used MassGIS data on roads and grocery stores to examine the
                state of food deserts in Boston. The road data was leveraged to
                create a network in ArcGIS with a time cost for traversal based
                on the average walking speed of a middle-aged adult. I could
                then use grocery stores and MBTA stations as nodes to create
                service areas. The gaps in service could then be used to
                apportion census data and approximate the proportion of
                residents that are out of reach of grocery stores without a
                faster mode of transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The results were pretty encouraging for the state of Boston food
                access. The vast majority of Boston residents live within a
                20-minute walk of a grocery store, and most of the gaps were in
                unpopulated areas such as parks or the airport. However, the
                gaps that did exist should be considered when planning new bus
                routes and transit expansions where they are not already served.

                BlueBikes has been a resounding success of a program. Ridership
                numbers have increased consistently, even through the pandemic.
                However, it's clear that BlueBikes is not equally successful
                across all neighborhoods and segments of Bostonians. I had the
                opportunity to talk to a group of high school students primarily
                from Roxbury about BlueBikes. Most of the students had heard of
                BlueBikes, but none of them knew anyone who used the system. One
                student remarked that it seemed pointless to rent a bike when
                they already had a car that could take them anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                This led me to investigate which demographics were using
                BlueBikes. BlueBikes releases anonymized data about trips taken
                each month. My goal was to focus on commuter behavior as that is
                one of the best use cases for BlueBikes and it helps me make
                some assumptions for analysis. To do this, I filtered the data
                to weekdays and BlueBikes subscribers. Only rides started
                between 7:00 and 9:59 or rides ended between 4:00 and 6:59 would
                count towards each station's total ride count. The aim was to
                only count ridership from riders' "home" station which I would
                use to create a model with various census demographics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The resulting model found a significant relationship with
                income, GINI (Inequality Measure), and the population proportion
                Ages 18-34. This affirmed BlueBikes' popularity among college
                students and hinted at an economic barrier to BlueBikes usage.
                This study was done before the significant price decrease for
                income-eligible Boston residents, and the network of stations
                and bike lanes has only continued to expand. I hope these
                programs will continue to encourage wider adoption.
