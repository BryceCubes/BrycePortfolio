            <p>
              I am a candidate for a Master of Science in Urban Informatics at
              Northeastern University and a research assistant at the Boston
              Area Research Initiative (BARI). My current research focuses on
              identifying policy levers to alleviate heat and air pollution in
              the greater Boston area by examining potential causes at a
              regional level.

              <br /><br />

              I grew up in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and I've been a proud
              Boston resident since 2017. My goal is to help Massachusetts
              become a more equitable and efficient place for all its residents.
              While most of my work is focused the environment and
              transportation, I'm interested in all topics related to urban
              planning and municipal operations.

              <h3>Food Deserts and Mobility</h3>
              <p>
                I currently live in a part of the city that is about a 20 minute
                walk away from the nearest grocery store. This combined with the
                lack of tree canopy on that walk led me to use the MBTA rapid
                transit system to take the train to a grocery store located very
                close to a station. The travel time is about the same, but it's
                much cooler and easier. I wondered what other means are
                available to bridge the gap between where people live and where
                they buy fresh food.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used MassGIS data on roads and grocery stores to examine the
                state of food deserts in Boston. I used the road data to create
                a network in ArcGIS with a time cost for traversal based on the
                average walking speed of a middle-aged adult. I could then use
                grocery stores and MBTA stations as nodes to create service
                areas to analyze where the gaps are and how connected grocery
                stores are to the rapid transit network.
              </p>
              <p>
                The results were pretty encouraging for the state of Boston food
                access. The vast majority of Boston residents live within a 20
                minute walk of a grocery store, and most of the gaps were in
                unpopulated areas such as parks or the airport. However, the
                gaps that did exist should be considered when planning new bus
                routes and transit expansions where they are not already served.

              <p>
                BlueBikes has been a resounding success of a program. Ridership
                numbers have increased consistently, even through the pandemic.
                However, it's clear that BlueBikes is not equally successful
                across all neighborhoods and segments of Bostonians. While I was
                examining the BlueBikes data I had the opportunity to talk to a
                group of high school students primarily from Roxbury. Most of
                the students had heard of BlueBikes, but none of them knew
                anyone who used the system. One student remarked that it seemed
                pointless to rent a bike when they already had a car that could
                take them anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                This led me to investigate who was using BlueBikes, especially
                as a commuting tool.
