              I am a candidate for a Master of Science in Urban Informatics at
              Northeastern University and a Research Assistant at the Boston
              Area Research Initiative (BARI). My current research aims to
              identify policy levers to alleviate heat and air pollution in the
              greater Boston area by examining potential causes and effects at a
              regional level.
              <br /><br />

              I grew up in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and I've been a proud
              Boston resident since 2017. My goal is to help Massachusetts
              become a more equitable and efficient place for all its residents.
              While most of my work is focused on the environment and
              transportation, I'm interested in all topics related to urban
              planning and municipal operations.

              <h3>MAPC Multi-Hazard Research</h3>
              <p>
                Heat and Air Pollution are frequently expressed as separate
                aggregations up to the census tract or town average. However,
                there is significant variation within these aggregations, even
                between adjacent streets. These microspatial inequities were
                identified within Boston in a paper from
                <a
                  href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/2984"
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  OBrien & Mueller (2023).
                </a>
                The impetus of this project was to verify how these differences
                are expressed on a regional scale and use information about
                nearby infrastructure to identify drivers of heat and air
                pollution. Preliminary findings indicate that these microspatial
                inequities remain significant throughout the region, adding
                additional nuance to how we understand and address environmental
                hazards across a wider variety of community types.
              </p>
              <p>
                I merged street and parcel data by heavily simplifying street
                names in both datasets and joining the closest matching street.
                I used this along with the structures dataset to determine the
                effective street height and width which determines the air
                flushing rate that affects air pollution exposure. The streets
                are then used to extract the satellite data on carbon monoxide
                emissions, land surface temperature, albedo, tree canopy, and
                impervious surface percentage to examine the drivers of heat and
                air pollution along with some other factors. Putting these
                factors into a mixed effects model allows me to understand how
                local and nearby factors affect the livability of each street.
              </p>
              <p>
                The final models and findings are currently in the drafting
                process, but some things are very clear. The microspatial
                inequities that O'Brien & Mueller found in Boston continue to
                persist throughout the region. Streets are no longer the clear
                highest source of variance, but street level infrastructure is
                the biggest determinant of conditions across scale. Heat and air
                pollution are also rather strongly correlated together to create
                overall high hazard areas. This is illustrated by the first two
                maps showing neighborhood level exposure to each and the
                within-town correlation between heat and air pollution. Recent
                studies also show that the combination of these two hazards
                together significantly increases mortality rates

                This combination is also negatively correlated with income,
                indicating that poorer residents suffer much higher exposure
                levels than their wealthier counterparts.

              <h3>Boston Food Desert Study</h3>
              <p>
                I currently live in a part of the city that is about a 20-minute
                walk away from the nearest grocery store. This combined with the
                lack of tree canopy on that walk led me to use the MBTA rapid
                transit system to take the train to a grocery store located very
                close to a station. The travel time is about the same, but it's
                much cooler and easier. I wondered what other means are
                available to bridge the gap between where people live and where
                they buy fresh food.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used MassGIS data on roads and grocery stores to examine the
                state of food deserts in Boston. The road data was leveraged to
                create a network in ArcGIS with a time cost for traversal based
                on the average walking speed of a middle-aged adult. I could
                then use grocery stores and MBTA stations as nodes to create
                service areas. The gaps in service could then be used to
                apportion census data and approximate the proportion of
                residents that are out of reach of grocery stores without a
                faster mode of transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The results were pretty encouraging for the state of Boston food
                access. The vast majority of Boston residents live within a
                20-minute walk of a grocery store, and most of the gaps were in
                unpopulated areas such as parks or the airport. However, the
                gaps that did exist should be considered when planning new bus
                routes and transit expansions where they are not already served.

                <h3>BlueBikes Equity Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  BlueBikes has been a resounding success of a program.
                  Ridership numbers have increased consistently, even through
                  the pandemic. However, it's clear that BlueBikes is not
                  equally successful across all neighborhoods and segments of
                  Bostonians. I had the opportunity to talk to a group of high
                  school students primarily from Roxbury about BlueBikes. Most
                  of the students had heard of BlueBikes, but none of them knew
                  anyone who used the system. One student remarked that it
                  seemed pointless to rent a bike when they already had a car
                  that could take them anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This led me to investigate which demographics were using
                  BlueBikes. BlueBikes releases anonymized data about trips
                  taken each month. My goal was to focus on commuter behavior as
                  that is one of the best use cases for BlueBikes and it helps
                  me make some assumptions for analysis. To do this, I filtered
                  the data to weekdays and BlueBikes subscribers. Only rides
                  started between 7:00 and 9:59 or rides ended between 4:00 and
                  6:59 would count towards each station's total ride count. The
                  aim was to only count ridership from riders' "home" station
                  which I would use to create a model with various census
                  demographics.

                  The resulting model found a significant relationship with
                  income, GINI (Inequality Measure), and the population
                  proportion Ages 18-34. This affirmed BlueBikes' popularity
                  among college students and hinted at an economic barrier to
                  BlueBikes usage. This study was done before the significant
                  price decrease for income-eligible Boston residents, and the
                  network of stations and bike lanes has only continued to
                  expand. I hope these programs will continue to encourage wider
                  adoption.

                  Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs allow people to
                  connect directly with farmers to subscribe to the harvest of
                  one or several partnered farms. This model helps farmers with
                  money upfront at the beginning of the season and helps them
                  sell some less well-known regional crops. It also brings
                  people in to share in the risks of farming so bad harvests
                  from weather or insects will be less likely to put the farm
                  out of commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am a long-time CSA subscriber at my neighborhood's local
                  community organization called
                  <a href="https://eastiefarm.com/" target="_blank"
                    >Eastie Farm.</a
                  >
                  This organization is a hugely important community asset with a
                  "pick your price" style of CSA shares allowing more fortunate
                  residents to support their neighbors. I love having access to
                  fresh and local food and learning to cook with produce that I
                  never used before through their CSA program which has grown
                  massively over the last few years. They also organize many
                  local events to educate and strengthen community ties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a staff member sent out an email asking for people with
                  GIS experience, I was quick to respond and offer myself up to
                  help. They wanted a map to highlight their CSA partner farms
                  and show where they all are. We eventually landed on the map
                  on the left here with a combination of individual and
                  aggregated farms to highlight individuals where possible but
                  prevent farms from overlapping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Eastie Farm
                  whenever they need to create maps in GIS. I'm also looking
                  forward to continuing to support this wonderful organization
                  and local farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you aren't already, consider joining a local CSA. See if
                  there are any close to you:
